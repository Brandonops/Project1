### Python First project: Typing Speed Test


# Python 3 was used to create the project while also using the imported library of Pygame.
# This project was created to test how fast a user can type by using three different calculations:
1. Calculating the total time it takes for the user to complete the sentence and return the input with the return(enter) key.
2. Calculating the accuracy of the user input compared to the randomly imported sentence from "sentences.txt".
3. And calculating the words per minute.
